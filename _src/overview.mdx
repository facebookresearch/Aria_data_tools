# Overview

Aria Data Tools was [Project Aria's](https://www.projectaria.com/) first open source release, go to [projectaria.com](https://www.projectaria.com/) to find out about more recent open science initiatives and how to get involved.

## Aria Data Tools

Aria Data Tools was released on June 19 2022 for a tutorial at CVPR: [Towards always-on egocentric vision research using Metaâ€™s Aria glasses](https://ariatutorial2022.github.io/). This repo was deprecated in June 2023 when [Project Aria Tools](https://facebookresearch.github.io/projectaria_tools/docs/intro) was released.

We recommend using [Project Aria Tools](https://facebookresearch.github.io/projectaria_tools/docs/intro) wherever possible. Project Aria Tools does not have Aria Data Tool's aria_multi_viewer utility for visualizing multiple time-synchronized recordings, but it is more up to date and will continue to be maintained. [Getting Started With Aria Data Utilities](https://facebookresearch.github.io/projectaria_tools/docs/data_utilities/getting_started) in Project Aria Tools includes Jupyter Notebook Tutorials that can be run locally, or on Google Colab.

## Aria Pilot Dataset

[Aria Pilot Dataset documentation](/docs/pilotdata/pilotdata-index/) is stored in *Archive: Aria Data Tools*, because it was Project Aria's first open source initiative and it uses a different data structure compared to our latest open releases.
