:::info
These instructions will install Aria Data Tools. We recommend using [Project Aria Tools](https://facebookresearch.github.io/projectaria_tools/docs/intro) instead, wherever possible. It does not have the aria_multi_viewer utility for visualizing multiple time-synchronized recordings, but it is more up to date and will continue to be maintained. [Getting Started With Aria Data Utilities](https://facebookresearch.github.io/projectaria_tools/docs/data_utilities/getting_started) in Project Aria Tools includes Jupyter Notebook Tutorials that can be run locally, or on Google Colab.
