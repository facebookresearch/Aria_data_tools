Aria Pilot Dataset documentation is stored in *Archive: Aria Data Tools*, because it was Project Aria's first open source initiative and it uses a different data structure compared to our latest open releases.

# Speech2Text Output Data

Speech2Text Output Data provides text strings generated by Automatic Speech Recognition with timestamps and confidence rating.

Each recording has two .csv files that are the same, except  `speech2text/speech.csv` uses the wav file time domain and  `speech2text/speech_aria_domain.csv` uses Aria time domain.



**Table 1:** *`speech.csv` Structure*
