# Privacy

For all Project Aria data, we are committed to establishing best practices, transparently uncovering roadblocks, ensuring people have visibility into what information is being captured, and having processes to protect the information that is recorded. Participants will only record in either Meta offices, wearers’ private homes (with consent from all members of the household), or public spaces, and won’t record in private venues without written consent from such places. Before any information gathered in a public place is made available to our researchers, it is automatically scrubbed to blur faces and vehicle license plates.

AR devices and experiences will eventually enable deep connections between people and the things that matter most to them, providing more utility and information while decreasing the time spent looking down at various devices. Our approach to building an AR ecosystem will always put people before opportunity. It’s why we’ve created four key principles for responsible innovation that will keep us committed and guide us through uncharted landscapes. Designing technology that’s transparent, meaningful, considerate, and above all, human.
