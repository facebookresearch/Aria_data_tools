# How to Use the Tools

This section covers:


## [How Project Aria Uses VRS](aria-vrs.md)

Identifies VRS functions that Project Aria uses.


## [Sensors and Measurements](sensors-measurements.md)

How sensors are named and labelled in the tooling, coordinate systems, time and units of measurement.


## [Getting to Know and Use VRS data](use-vrs.md)

Commands that can be used to examine, extract and inspect data contained in any VRS file.


## [Accessing Aria Sensor Data: Aria Data Provider](dataprovider.md)

The Aria Data Provider provides a customized way to retrieve and read data from VRS files in an intuitive and effective way. We also provide instructions on how to use the tool and information about how we use VRS to do this.


## [Visualizing Aria Sequences & Pre-Computed Camera Trajectory](visualizing.md)

How to use the visualization tool to access and view Project Aria data.


## [Using Aria Calibration Sensor Data](calibration.md)

Project Aria devices contain multiple types of sensors that are all calibrated when each device is manufactured. The calibration process derives intrinsic and extrinsic parameters (relative poses between sensors) between some sensors that can be used to calibrate data.


## [Access Time Synchronized Data From Multiple Project Aria Recordings](multiple-recordings.md)

Instructions for how to use the EyeTorch extension in Pytorch for enables easy projection and un-projection of batches of points using a variety of linear and non-linear projection models.
