# Overview

Project Aria makes open data and open tooling available to support researchers expand the horizons of Augmented Reality, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence by releasing the Aria Pilot Dataset and Aria Research Kit: Aria Data Tools.


## What are Aria Data Tools?

Aria Data Tools provides C++ and Python tools to interact with [Project Aria](https://about.facebook.com/realitylabs/projectaria/) data to:


* Read & visualize Project Aria sequences and sensor data
* Retrieve calibration data and interact with Aria camera models

## What is Project Aria?

[Project Aria](https://about.facebook.com/realitylabs/projectaria/) is a research device that collects first-person view (egocentric) data in safe and controlled environments. Aria sensors suite are stored in [VRS](https://facebookresearch.github.io/vrs/docs/Overview) files, with data from:


* 1 x 120 degree FOV Rolling Shutter RGB camera
* 2 x 150 degree FOV Global Shutter mono cameras for SLAM & hand tracking
* 2 x 80 degree FOV Global Shutter mono cameras for Eye-tracking with IR illumination
* 2 x 1KHz IMU + Barometer and Magnetometer env. sensors
* 7 x 48 KHz spatial microphones
* GPS 1 Hz

## What is the Aria Pilot Dataset?

The Aria Pilot Dataset provides data from a variety of egocentric scenarios, from hiking outdoors to cooking to time synced multi-person multi-Project Aria device scenarios. Datasets also include Project Aria data time synced with data from XSens motion capture suits and multi-view camera recording rigs. We believe these datasets can enable researchers to build and foster reproducible research on Computer Vision and AI/ML algorithms for scene perception, reconstruction and user surrounding understanding.
